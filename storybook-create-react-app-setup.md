## Create the project using `create-react-app`

The simplest way to set up storybook is to install it into a project already set up with an existing framework. Options include Angular Workspace, Create React App, Vue CLI, Ember CLI. Storybook looks into the project's dependencies to set up the best configuration available.

First create project folder. Then `cd` into it and run

```
npx create-react-app .
```

## Install Storybook using `sb init`

Inside the project folder run

```
npx sb init
```

Storybook will install the required dependencies, setup scripts, add the default configuration, and some boilerplate stories.
